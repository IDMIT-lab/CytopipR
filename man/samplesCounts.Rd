\title{Sample Counts and Plot for CYTdata Object}
\usage{
samplesCounts(CYTdata, samples = NULL, sort = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{CYTdata}{A CYTdata object containing sample data.}

\item{samples}{A character vector of sample names to include in the analysis. If `NULL`, all samples are used.}

\item{sort}{A logical value indicating whether the resulting data should be sorted in descending order by the number of cells (default is `TRUE`).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot visualizing the number of cells per sample along with key statistical metrics.
}
\description{
This function computes the number of cells per sample in a CYTdata object and generates a plot with key statistical indicators such as mean, median, quantiles, and min/max values. It can optionally filter and sort the samples.
}
\details{
This function calculates the number of cells in each sample and then creates a plot to visualize the cell counts. The plot includes the following statistical lines:
- **Mean**: Green line
- **Min**: Blue line
- **25th Percentile (q25)**: Purple line
- **Median**: Red line
- **75th Percentile (q75)**: Purple line
- **Max**: Blue line

The function also includes data labels with the actual values of these metrics.

If `samples` is provided, only the specified samples are considered. If `sort` is set to `TRUE`, the resulting data will be sorted by the number of cells in descending order.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Plot the cell counts for all samples
cell_count_plot <- samplesCounts(CYTdata = cyt_data)

# Example 2: Plot the cell counts for specific samples
cell_count_plot <- samplesCounts(CYTdata = cyt_data, samples = c("Sample1", "Sample2"))

# Example 3: Plot the cell counts without sorting
cell_count_plot <- samplesCounts(CYTdata = cyt_data, sort = FALSE)

}
