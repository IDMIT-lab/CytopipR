\title{Perform Gating on CYTdata Object}
\usage{
CYTdataGating(CYTdata, samples = NULL, clustering = NULL, clusters = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{CYTdata}{An object of class \code{CYTdata} containing the cytometry data, cell metadata, clustering information, and other related attributes.}

\item{samples}{A character vector of sample IDs that should be included in the gating process. If \code{NULL}, clustering filtering will be applied (if provided).}

\item{clustering}{A character string specifying the clustering column name in the \code{cellClustering} slot to filter cells by their cluster assignment. Must be specified if \code{clusters} is provided.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of cluster identifiers that define which clusters should be kept in the gated data. If \code{NULL}, no clustering filtering is applied.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{CYTdata} object with the gated cells, preserving the metadata, clustering, and dimensionality reduction information after the gating process.
}
\description{
This function performs gating on a given cytometry dataset (CYTdata) by filtering cells based on specified sample IDs and clustering results. The function allows users to subset the data by selecting specific samples and/or clusters. It updates the `CYTdata` object to reflect the new, gated dataset, retaining the remaining data in the object.
}
\details{
The gating process subsets the cytometry data to only include the specified samples and/or clusters. If the \code{samples} argument is provided, cells belonging to the specified sample IDs are retained. If the \code{clusters} argument is provided, only cells from the specified clusters are included. The function updates the \code{CYTdata} object and ensures that clustering, dimensionality reduction, and metadata are also adjusted to reflect the gated dataset.

If both \code{samples} and \code{clustering} are specified, the cells will be filtered based on both criteria.

The function also ensures that the clustering levels, metadata levels, and other related elements are appropriately updated after the gating operation.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Gating based on specific sample IDs
CYTdata <- CYTdataGating(CYTdata = CYTdata, samples = c("Sample1", "Sample2"))

# Gating based on specific clusters in a clustering
CYTdata <- CYTdataGating(CYTdata = CYTdata,
                         clustering = "cluster1",
                         clusters = c("ClusterA", "ClusterB"))
